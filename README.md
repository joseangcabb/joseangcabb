## 👋 Hi there, I'm Jose Angel
🛠️ Senior Full-Stack Developer | 🇵🇪 Based in Peru

#### 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a `Senior Full-Stack Developer` with over **10 years of experience** designing, developing, and maintaining robust and scalable software solutions. A certified Systems Engineer, I've worked on remote projects for companies in the US and Latin America, from legacy systems to new production architectures.

#### 🏛️ Software Architecture
I design systems that actually work, applying scalability, maintainability, performance, security, observability, and other critical **“-ilities”** to real-world projects. I capture architectural decisions in **ADRs**, organize code into clear **logical components**, and choose **architectural styles** that accelerate development while controlling complexity. Every choice is guided by project needs, not theory.

#### 🤖 AI-enhanced Workflow
- 🧠 **Avante + MCP Hub**: AI-first Neovim setup with local/integrated models.
- 🧑‍💻 Use LLMs to refactor, debug, write, and document code within the editor.
- ⚙️ Integrated with my terminal, Git, and testing tools for full-stack workflows.
